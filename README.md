# DANPAD
Hello, this is my submission for hackpad. I hope you'll like it :)
# Features
- 6 keys
- EC11 rotary encoder for volume adjusting
- 2 SK6812 MINI RGB LEDs
- a 3d printed case
# CAD Model
I made the model for the case in Onshape. It has 4 pieces: the bottom and mid plate(separated in case i needed to change
something so that i dont have to reprint the entire case), the top plate and the knob

# PCB
I made the pcb in KiCad. I used the image converter in KiCad for the pictures.

# Firmware
I wrote the code with KMK. The rotary encoder changes the volume and the keys do functions that i'm going to change according my needs.
