# Features
- 6 keys
- EC11 rotary encoder for volume adjusting
- 2 SK6812 MINI RGB LEDs
- a 3d printed case

I made the model for the case in Onshape. It has 4 pieces: the bottom and mid plate(separated in case i needed to change
something so that i dont have to reprint the entire case), the top plate and the knob
